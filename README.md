# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, specifically designed for Arch Linux at the moment.

## .zshrc

Includes common emacs-style bindings including Ctrl+< to go back 1 word, and Ctrl+Backspace to delete the previous word.

`$` is also aliased to `sudo`, eg: `$ whoami`

## Ideas?

Please use **Issues**!
